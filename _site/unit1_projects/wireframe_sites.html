	The web page solves the issue of not having access to a subject matter expert. Quora is a community where you can crowdsource a solution to questions you might have. I'm not sure if it's a visuall challenge, but it looks like the notification count is a bit on my browswer. So it would appear that is is difficult to get the nav bar to display correctly in all of the possible browsers and screen sizes that exsist. Other than that, I can't really see many visual challenges as the site is extremely straight forward.
