<p> I plan to make the blog more visually appealing, but clearly defining the header, footer, content, and sidebar. This week I further my knowledge of absolute, relative, and static position which will help with this layout. I'll also seek to incorporate a responsive design for this template. Below is my mockup of the site </p>
