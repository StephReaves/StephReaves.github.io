		<h1>Margins, Borders, and Padding Do You Say?!?</h1>
		<p>I kind of think of Margins, Border, and Padding as a three ring bulleyes. Ok, probably a bad anaalogy, but if you think of your content as the bullseye, padding is the first closest ring, then the border ring, then the margin ring. Yea, that's really bad because all of this feeds into the box-model so I should stick with that. Hmmm.</p>

		<p>Well, how does one remember the order of Margins, Borders, and Padding? A mnemonic is probably a good idea here. So let's see: M-B-P or P-B-M??? I'll go with Peanut Butter and Mayo - Like only the best combos ever. Really. Actually I have no idea, but that's how I'm going to remember the three properties until it's second nature for me. </p>

		<p>In terms of how they all work together it all really sums together to create one cumulative distance from the content. In terms of adjusting these items you will use the property (e.g margin, border, or padding) in conjunction with a value (e.g 50px, or 2em). When doing this, you have control over all 4 sides of the box. The convention for altering these is margin: 5px (changes all edges by 5px), margin: 5px, 10px (changes the top and bottom by 5px and the right and left by 10px), and margin: 10px, 5px, 20px (changes to top by 10px, the right and left by 5px, and the bottom by 15px). 
		</p>

		<p>Here is an example diagram, from w3schools, that might help you visualize the box model.</p>
