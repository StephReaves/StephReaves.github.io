		<p><b><u><h3>Recursion</b></u></h3>One of my favorite programming concepts is recursion. Recursion is a way to call a method on itself while its in itself. OK, that a little rough to handled. However, at it's core you can create a method and then use that method within the method and nothing horrible happens. There is a caveat to this statement in that the sequence should reach a terminal value so you do not create an infinite loop. I love the concept of recursion because it makes quick work of a lot of lines of code that would be written, by storing these characteristics within the code block.</p>

		<p>Recursion can be used to make short work of creating the fibonanci sequence or any sequence of numbers that follow a pattern that can be modeled in Ruby. Below is a link to a source I found really helpful on the topic. It's a blog post by another programmer who likens recursion to the movie inception. If you haven't seen inception, the premise of the movie is that there are multiple levels of reality. As you start at the top level, you continue to go one level deeper until you reach the core. If this example doesn't help maybe think of faberge eggs. With faberge eggs there are 8 or 9 eggs contained within one large egg. When you open up the first egg, a smaller egge is revealed. This continues until you reach the terminal egg. All of the eggs have similar charactersitics and follow the design scheme of the artist.</p>

		<p>In the faberge example, the program is given certain charactersitics that transform the objects passed into the code. The code will open another layer of itself executed on itself. So this concept is pretty hard to explain. One last shot, think of it like a rabbit hole that the code goes down. I'll revisit this one if I have time in the coming weeks.</p>
