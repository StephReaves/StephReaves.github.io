		<p><b><u><h3>What's the deal with Ruby Loops?</b></u></h3> </p>
		<p>Well I've been looping around in Ruby for a bit now and to be honest it's getting a lil loopy... Okay, sorry for that one, but I had to put some bad humor in the blog. Anyway, there are three main loops in Ruby.</p>
			
		<p>	These loops are: 
		<ul>
			<li>While</li>
			<li>Until</li>
			<li>For</li>
		</ul>
		I'll go into each in a bit more detail below. At a high level, they all allow you to run a specific piece of code for an indicated situation. The loop should keep track of itself in terms of a count if one is utilized, a statement that ends the loop (this is key so you don't melt your computer), and the output that you wish returned. 
		</p>

		<p><b><h4>While:</b></h4> While will execute a block of code in Ruby until the condition is not true at which point the code at the end will execute. This is the most straightforward of all of the loops. Honestly, while is my go to loop in Ruby. In terms of the syntax, it's fairly straight forward. You can check out the syntax for While and the other loop types <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/glossary/ruby/loops" target =_blank>here</a>
		
		</p>
		<p><b><h4>Until:</b></h4> Unless will excute a block of code so long as the condition is false. Once it is true, then the code at the end will execute. To be honest, I rarely use unless as I find it more taxing to think on the negative side of a statement. I realize that until helps with readability of code when it makes more sense to write a negative statement. It's definitely something that I'll have to work on over the course of DBC. 
			
		</p>
		<p><b><h4>For:</b></h4> For is the "workhorse" of looping in Javascript. However, I've found that in Ruby, it's rare that you want to use the For loop. Often times, it introduces additional code that is not helpful in the form of a needless itterator and if you need to itterate, then it's best to use .each in most situations... So moving forward, I'm retiring For in Ruby. It's going to be While or Until for me.
