		<p><b><u><h3>Pairing is Caring</b></u></h3> Well at this point, I've paired close to 10 times in either a pairing session or GPS. I must say, the experience is much more enjoyable than I anticipated on the whole. Like anything, there are people that I click with a bit more. I think it's because our thinking styles are similar. Before I got deep into pairing I thought opposite styles would work, but I'm finding this isn't the case. You might ask how do I know I have a different thinking style from some people... I just review their week 3 blog post, which is super helpful for pairing prep or to understand how a session was derailed.</p>

		<p>There are a few people where we've paired together 3 times and we definitely have a flow now. We know how to push each other and nudge each other along to great solutions. The most rewarding pairing experience so far has been to implementing a piece of code that neither one of thought we were capable of doing, but wait their is more... We refactored it so well our mother's would be proud - Yes, it so clear our non-programming mother's could read our code.</p>
		
		<p>I find both giving and receiving feedback to be rewarding. Giving feedback is an opportunity for me to help someone hone their craft and receiving feedback is an opportunity for me to hone mine. The most helpful feedback I have received has been around speaking up when I have questions or something isn't tracking along - this will help ensure I fully understand the code and topic at hand.</p>
		
		<p>When writing feedback I rarely encounter issues around making it specific and kind. At times, I do struggle with actionable feedback, because some of my pairs are truly great. Since we've found what works we pair with each once a week or so. So, I have a pair that is completely new once a week and one that is an unknown each week. For me this works. It gives me the consistency I enjoy balanced with a bit of variety. I have to admit when I pair with someone new, I am a bit anxious at first. It's the standard emotions of will we be able to do the challenge, will we get along, is this person going to be a jerk? Luckily, to date everyone has been good or great.</p>
