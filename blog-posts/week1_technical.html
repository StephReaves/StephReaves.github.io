		<div class="captionbox"> <p> Buzzfeed has a straightforward and clean layout for all of the content that is showcased on the site. Buzzfeed is one of favorite sites for it's sheer entertainment value. Basically, no matter your interest, you can find something to explore on this site. </p>

		<p> I like that the trending content is off to the right in a sidebar. The main nav bar is showcased at the top. They also do a great job of spacing out the content with the individual divs. With the sidebar, they have a 3 column layout which is pretty common in beautifully laid out websites.</p> </div>

		<div class="captionbox"> <p> Product Hunt is a very minimal website. It's a straightforward design of the daily hunts and upvote mechanisms. </p>

		<p>This is one of my favorite sites, because it's an easy way to view content, particpate by voting, and see others feedback. There is an option to subscribe to the email list, but it's not too distracting. Completely off to the right is the navigation bar - as this is likely the last thing anyone will utilize on this site.</p> </div>

		<div class="captionbox"> <p> Quora is one of my favorite sites as it has social elements layered in by highlighting my friends response, but it also enables me to continually learn from others or pose my own questions. Similar to Product Hunt, there is a minimalist layout.</p>

		 <p>A search bar and a bare bones nav bar are at the top so as to not distract from the core of the website. Content is featured in the center and content that is most relevant to me is surfaced. An user can easily sort by their Feeds which is off to the left in a side bar, but isn't too in your face. </p> </div>
