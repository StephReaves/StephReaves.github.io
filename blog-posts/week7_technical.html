		<p><b><u><h3>Who's down with OOP or FP?</b></u></h3>I'll attempt to review for the Ruby newbie the difference between Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. Let's start off with the fact that Ruby is an Object Oriented language. Everything in Ruby is an Object - well most everything. There are a few exceptions to this statement. However, the objects in Ruby are intended to be organized with data structures, datafields and, methods together with their unique interactions. With a functional programming language the compuataion is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions and it does not have a place for state and mutable data.</p>

		<p><b><u><h3>So what's underneath the hood?</b></u></h3>

		The following are some the main characterstics of OOP:
		<ul> 
			<li>Objects</li>
			<li>Methods</li>
			<li>Message passing</li>
			<li>Encapsulation</li>
			<li>Inheritance</li>
			<li>Data Absstraction</li>
		</ul>
		In constract, FP has the following main charactersitics:
		<ul>
			<li>Lambda calculus</li>
			<li>Compositionality</li>
			<li>Formula</li>
			<li>Recursion</li>
			<li>No side effects</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p><b><u><h3>Do you prefer to drive an Benz or Audi?</b></u></h3>

		I mentioned earlier that Ruby is a OOP language, but here are a few other OOP languages for reference:
		<ul>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>C++</li>
		</ul>

		We certainly don't want to forget about functional programming languages like:
		<ul>
			<li>Haskell</li>
			<li>Clojure</li>
			<li>Scala</li>
			<li>Python</li>
		</ul>

		Woah, how is Python both an OOP and FP? Actually, Python supports many more programming paradigns like: imperative and procedural programming. On the surface, Python seems like it offers up a number of options once the language is mastered. From what I can gather, Ruby and Python are fairly similar in syntax. So Python, might be the next language I learn after I master Ruby in a couple of months. :)  </p>

		<p><b><u><h3>Does it come down to your driving needs?</b></u></h3>
		It can be difficult to decide when to use an OOP versuses a FP language. I certainly am no expert here. However, if you are looking to model the project (world) with objects and closely tie the data to a a specific object, then you will use OOP. The core of FP is that the data is only loosely tied to the function. Basically, FP is all about how the data flows. ÃŸ
