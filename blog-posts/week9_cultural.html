		<p><b><u><h3>Asking Questions</b></u></h3> 
		I've made an effort to ask good questions in the past. Basically, I try to thoroughly research my question and its respective topic prior to asking the question directly in person or on a blog. Throughout my life, I've always found that it's best if I can figure out the answers to my questions by struggling through the problem myself. However, when I ask a question, I try to provide the context, what actions I was taking, the task I am trying to accomplish, expected results, and actual results. Not all points are necessary in every question, but it just helps me make sure I'm not missing any important information. 
		</p>

		<p>I really haven't asked many questions in the Google+ community. However, the few questions I asked have been about average quality. What makes them average quality is that I researchd responses to similar questions prior to my posting. From there, I highlight how my situation was different by providing specific code examples. The outcome was a few people in the Lions community came to my aid with suggestions that remedied the problem. It was a learning momemnt for me and really anyone who had a similar question around fetching with github.</p>
