		<p><b><u><h3>Impostor Syndrome & Sterotype Threat... EEK!</b></u></h3> 
		So it's safe to say that I have felt Impostor Syndrome and Stereotype Threat personally. I would say that I'm more prone to impostor syndrome than stereotype threat. However, this is the first time I'm reading about stereotype threat and maybe it has been a bigger factor in my life than I realize. I think some reflection on the topic of stereotype threat is in order.
		</p>

		<p>In terms of immpostor syndrome, I probably have this feeling at least once a week. Even today, as I tinkered with my code to get something to finally work, my first thought was 'hey, fake it to you make it'. I wonder if one of my male counterparts in the same situation would have just confidentaly took it all in stride. Being aware of impostor syndrome is helpful, as I know I'm not alone in these feelings and that they are likely irrational and unwarranted, which helps with me dealing with these thoughts</p>
		
		<p>With stereotype threat, it seems like this roadblock to success functions on a subconscious order where impostor syndrome is more of a conscious thought. The reason I say his is that very rarely do I think of race of gender as I enter an exam, challenging situation, or before performing tasks. If anything, this would be a motivator for me. My parents told me I had to be twice as good to obtain half as much. So from a child, I've known I will be disadvantage in America as a result of my characteristics. However, I've used this to fuel my success to date. It's not that I don't think this is real and isn't impacting me. It's just that I've never really experience this to my knowledge. Potentially, I would preform even better if my sterortype threat was removed?</p>
		
		<p>It's great to be presented with these new ways of thinking. Just being exposed to these experiments and results, will positively impact me and my future as I'm more knowledgable and aware. I'll definitely be on the look out as I move forward for stereotype syndrome.</p>
