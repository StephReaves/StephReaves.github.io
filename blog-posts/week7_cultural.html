		<p><b><u><h3>Values</b></u></h3> 
		I think confidence goes a long way in life. I've gone through phases of over confidence (arrogance) and under confidence. However, I strive to have just 'confidence'. The reason I find this to be important is that so often in life people get ahead meerly by having the confidence to speak up or raise their hand. Not only do I strongly value confidence for myself, but I value it in others.

		<p>My best friend recently became engaged and she's asked my advice on a number of things relating to the wedding. However, the biggest piece of advice she is seeking comes down to relationship management. So things like who to invite, how many people to invite, how to engage with her in-laws about the invite list and the actual wedding. I definitely don't envy her in this situation. Managing relationships to success for a wedding is true art.</p>
		
		<p>Reviewing my values makes me feel like I'm an ambitious and thoughful person. It's interesting that last week I didn't beleive I suffered from sterotype threat; however, this week, I'm stating that I want to work on my confidence. I think that's at least a signal that I suffer from some form of stereotype threat as on paper there is no reason for me to have a lack of confidence.</p>
		
		<p>The things that help when I'm feeling down are: exercise, music, and a good night's rest. Usually, one of these things will do the trick. If all else fails, I have a list of supporters that I can ring up to cheer me up. I'm ready for all of the hardwork and rewards that will come from DBC onsite.</p>
