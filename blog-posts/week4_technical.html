		<p><b><u><h3>Pros of Javascript:</b></u></h3> </p>
		<p>
			After reading a few articles on the web, most sources point to the big benefits of Javascript being the fact that it's the language of broswers (does it get any better than this), does have server side support (not only for the front-end developers), its lightening fast speed, and wealth of libraries. To be honest, the last two bullet points don't mean much to me at this stage. I can understand how speed and robust libraries is of value as they aren't constraints in the work flow. However, I've not experience the benefit firsthand so it's more of a benefit to be seen. Quora had quite a few threads on Javascript and here is the link to the one I found most helpful: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/Why-is-JavaScript-so-popular" target="_blank">Quora on Popularity</a> of Javascript. </p>
			
		<p>	In summary the pros of Javascript are: 
		<ul>
			<li>Language of the browsers</li>
			<li>Does have server side side support</li>
			<li>Speed</li>
			<li>Libraries</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p><b><u><h3>Cons of Javascript:</b></u></h3> </p>
		<p>
			There are a few things that immediately pop into my mind when I think of cons of Javascript. These cons are the syntax of the language seems a bit weak. It's almost as if rules are not really rules, but more suggestions in the language which can be confusing for a n00b. From research, it seems that different browsers will render Javascript differently, which creates headaches as there isn't one consistent standard. Another commonly cited con is a security issues although I haven't really bumped into this issue, but I do realize how this could be a big problem. Here is a link to a Quora article that helped further my understanding: <a href="http://www.quora.com/JavaScript-programming-language/What-are-some-limitations-of-JavaScript" target="_blank">Quora on limitations</a> of Javascript. </p>

		<p> In summary the cons of Javascript are:
		<ul>
			<li>Poorly structured syntax - Can I even claim that with my coding knowledge?</li>
			<li>Inconsistent rendering across browsers</li>
			<li>Weak security</li>
		</ul>
