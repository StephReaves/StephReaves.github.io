		<div class="captionbox"> <p> Buzzfeed has a straightforward and clean layout for all of the content that is showcased on the site. Buzzfeed is one of favorite sites for it's sheer entertainment value. Basically, no matter your interest, you can find something to explore on this site. </p>

		<p> I like that the trending content is off to the right in a sidebar. The main nav bar is showcased at the top. They also do a great job of spacing out the content with the individual divs. With the sidebar, they have a 3 column layout which is pretty common in beautifully laid out websites.</p> </div>
