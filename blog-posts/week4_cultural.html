		<p><b><u><h3>Problems... Everyone has them:</b></u></h3> In tech, these problems vary vastly. One the cultural side the lack of diversity found in the room is of particular interest to me. Should I be concerned about my career progression and potential as a result? I choose not to focus on this line of thinking. Instead, what can be done to improve the gender and race gap at tech companies? Closing this gap is important on a fundamental human level, but there are countless studies that teams that are diverse in experience and perspective perform better than an homogenous team. The big questions are how to create an open and inclusive environment for women and minorities and how to create an ecosystem that produces trained and talented minority programmers.</p>
		<p>Below are my musings on the matter: 
		<ul>
			<li>Open communication about the current issue</li>
			<li>Have a key champion to drive the change at top companies </li>
			<li>Grants & Internships to encourage top minority talent to pursue mathematics and computer science in college </li>
			<li>Summer programs, after school programs, and enrichment programs targeted at the specific group from a young age </li>
		</ul>
		I found these articles a good read on the topic: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/men-initiating-change-an-important-step-to-amending-techs-bro-culture/?ncid=tcdaily" target="_blank">TechCrunch:"Men Initiating Change"</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2014/07/31/diversity-in-tech-requires-the-voices-of-page-dorsey-mayer-zuckerberg/13143335/" target="_blank"> Tech Execs Need to Speak Up</a> </p>
		<p>At the end of the day, we're all in this together. DBC is doing a great job of encouraging diversity within its program. Specifically, the grants and fellowships to minorities that enroll in the program is an excellent step. Also, from what I can tell, DBC selects candidates that are kind and respective of all people regardless of any difference. So I'm super excited to take make this big career move with DBC.</p>
