		<p><b><u><h3>Gregorc Thinking Style:</b></u></h3> My Gregorc thinking style is concrete random (11pts) followed by abstract random (10pts). I find this interesting that I would be so close on both abstract and concrete. I definitely agree that my first thoughts are geared towards being concrete versus being abstract. In general, with both there are points that I agree with and disagree with about my personality and thinking style.</p>
		<p>I would agree with the preferences of Concrete Random of: 
		<ul>
			<li>Experimenting to find answers</li>
			<li>Taking risks</li>
			<li>Using my intuition</li>
			<li>Solving problems independently</li>
		</ul>
		So while at DBC I'll try to be authentic and upfront with my tendencies. Hopefully, this will allow me to find a subset of individuals that complement each other thinking styles. For instance, it would be good to have individuals with different thinking styles to create a diverse work group that will approach the various tasks effectively.

		<p><b><u><h3>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset:</b></u></h3> I am definitely more of a growth mindset type of person. However, I would say that I'm Fixed in a sense - Basically, I think that everyone has a maximum potential and that is fixed. However, everyone should work towards their full potential which makes me growth mindeset oriented.</p>

		<p>I came across this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/29/opinion/dweck-simmons-girls-confidence-failure/" target="_blank">CNN article</a>, which I think does a great job of outlining how a growth vs. fixed mindset can impact an individual career and life trajectory. One of the big takeaways for me is that perserverance is a key trait to possess when tackling something new and challenging. At times the only thing that distinguishes someone that succeeds from someone that fails is perserverance. So as I continue on my coding journey, I will seek to bring 100% of my foucus and ability everyday to continue on the path to success.</p>
