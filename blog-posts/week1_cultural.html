		<div class="captionbox"> <p> I'm super excited to attend Dev Bootcamp. Shereef, definitely has an interesting perspective on life and how it should be viewed. </p>

		<p> Of the people I've meet in our cohort - I think we will take ownership. It's something I'll remind myself that I'll keep the mindset of the creator. It's a bit concerning that how I've been sucessful to date is kind of opposite to Dev Bootcamp. So the fear of failure is slightly surfacing at this point.</p> 

		<p> It's great to hear that the environment at Dev Bootcamp is more collaborative than competitive. I tend to thrive most in enirvonments like this. The qualities that Dev Bootcamp value: integrity, ethics, persistance, perserverance (e.g Emotional Intelligence) is something that I want to hone over my exeperience. Dev Bootcamp is truly a special place in that EI is valued more than IQ.</p> 

		<p> Estimating the time of work and allocating enough time is something that I struggle with. Even with submitting the first week of challenges I'm having issues. This is something that I'll have to keep an eye out at Dev Bootcamp. I'll definitely have to use the 20 minute time limit technique.</p>
