		<p><b><u><h3>Compass of Shame</b></u></h3> 
		In general, I try to be fairly even keel with my emotion. I think I do this by avoiding situations that put me at potential risk of failure or shame. Once recent conflict that comes to mind is a trip with 3 friends. We were in a foreign country where the rules of the roads are very different (e.g drive on the left side etc,.). One of my friend volunteered to drive as no one else really wanted the responsibility. Being her closest friend, I offered to sit up front to provide directions and coach her through the process. Midway through we had some very vocal backset drivers. I'm not sure why everyone became very upset, but it became the backset crew versus the frontset crew. Everyone said some things that they regretted	
		</p>

		<p>The source of the conflict really was lack of communication. Honestly, 9 out of 10 issues I've had in life have been due to miscommunication. Immediately after the event, everyone went to their room; luckily the villa had 4 rooms. Everyone cooled off in their space. However, we hadn't spoken about it at all, we just avoided the topic. Since my tactic is usually to practice avoidence I knew exactly what was occuring. So one by one I discussed the car ride with my friends. Eventually it became clear that no one wanted to be hurtful; however, it was just an intense situation that escalated quickly. By discussing this, we were all able to gain a better understanding.</p>
		
		<p>The process of discussing our issues definitely helped us to move past the conflict. We all hugged it out and started a new game of Perudo - if you have never heard of this game I recommend it if you like dice games. While we would have moved past the conflict without the conversations. I don't think we would have been in as good of a place as we are now. So it was worthwhile to spend a little time in the moment addressing the issue so we dont have to spend a lot of time later if it becomes a big issue. All in all, I'm happy with the outcome. </p>
