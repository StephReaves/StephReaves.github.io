I'm an ex-startup leader turned software engineer. I graduated from Wharton, with a MBA in 2011, and worked for three years on New York's Silicon Alley. Currently, I'm a coach for incoming students at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> and I'm seeking full-time employment as a front end web developer. 

In short, I love learning - I'm a geekette. I'm passionate about being my "best self" in all aspects of my personal and professional life. So whether we're talking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics" target="_blank">Numismatics</a>, poker, or travel I'm engaged and opinionated. So shoot me an e-mail any time at <a href="mailto: stephanie.reaves@gmail.com" target="_blanl=k"> Stephanie.Reaves [at] gmail [dot] com </a>.
